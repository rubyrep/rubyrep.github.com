title: "rubyrep version 1.0.6 released"

Quick update: I have released version 1.0.6 of rubyrep.
Changes:

* Bug fix: rubyrep does not assume anymore that replication events appear in the @rr_pending_changes@ table in sequential order.
  (This could lead to some changes being left behind and only getting picked up after a replication restart.)
* Feature: the replication daemon is now more resilient towards network timeouts.
  (I. e. less likely to get stuck.)
* Feature: introduction of an @:after_infrastructure_setup@ handler that allows users to execute custom code after infrastructure tables are created.
  (Useful to e. g. grant additional database users access to the @rr_pending_changes@ table.)

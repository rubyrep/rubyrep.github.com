h2. Event filters

Event filters can be used to 
* filter which unsynced / unreplicated differences should be processed by rubyrep
* implement custom sync / replication actions

This is done by assigning the custom event filter to the (table specific) option @:event_filter@.
An event filter implements the @before_sync@ and @before_replicate@ methods[1]. 

The @before_sync@ / @before_replicate@ methods
* are called for each each detected sync / replication difference 
* must return +true+ for rubyrep to proceed with syncing / replicating the difference
* can use the calling parameters to access both databases for custom actions

fn1. It is OK to only implement one of the methods.

h2. Sync filter

@before_sync@ is called with
* @table@: name of the left table (of the sync difference)
* @key@: the column_name => value hash of the primary key of the sync difference
* @sync_helper@: a "@SyncHelper@":http://rubyrep.rubyforge.org/classes/RR/SyncHelper.html through which the database can be accessed
* @type@: type of sync difference (@:left@, @:right@ or @:conflict@)
* @row@:
** for @:left@ or @:right@ differences: the column_name => value pairs of the unsynced row
** for @:conflict@: an array of conflicting left and right row  

h2. Replication filter

@before_replicate@ is called with
* @table@: name of the left table (of the unreplicated change)
* @key@: the column_name => value hash of the primary key of the changed row
* @replication_helper@: a "@ReplicationHelper@":http://rubyrep.rubyforge.org/classes/RR/ReplicationHelper.html enabling database access
* @diff@: the "@ReplicationDifference@":http://rubyrep.rubyforge.org/classes/RR/ReplicationDifference.html describing the unreplicated change.

h2. Example

The following simple example configures rubyrep to sync / replicate only accounts with a primary key < 100:

<pre><code class="brush: ruby; gutter: false">
...

class AccountFilter
  def before_sync(table, key, sync_helper, type, row)
    key['id'] < 100
  end

  def before_replicate(table, key, replication_helper, diff)
    key['id'] < 100
  end
end 

config.add_table_option 'accounts', :event_filter => AccountFilter.new

...   
</code></pre>

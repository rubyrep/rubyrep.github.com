h2. Replication  between more than two databases

Basically rubyrep can only scan / sync / replicate betwee two databases.
However there is a simple approach possible to keep more than two databases in sync.

Example:

* Scenario: The databases A, B and C should be kept in sync.
* Solution:
** A replicates with C
** B replicates with C

Effectively this is a replication in the star schema and an arbitrary number of databases could be kept in syn.

To accomplish this, the @:rep_prefix@ of all replication setups has to be kept unique. 
(This will ensure that each replication uses it's own triggers, change log tables, etc.)

|_. |Hint|Use the ruby "@require@":http://www.ruby-doc.org/core/classes/Kernel.html command to keep the rubyrep config files DRY(Don't repeat yourself).|

|_. |Important|MySQL only supports one after trigger per table. This means that above approach is not possible with MySQL|

h2. Sync hooks

Sync hooks are custom behavior that can be execute before or after a table sync.
Relevant options:

* @:before_table_sync@
* @:after_table_sync@

h2. S&zwnj;Q&zwnj;L Statements as sync hook

In it's simplest form, the hook can simply execute an SQL command (E. g. to disable /enable referential constraints, etc.).
Example:

<code class="brush: ruby; gutter: false">
...  
config.include_tables 'emp',
  :before_table_sync => "SET foreign_key_checks = 0",
  :after_table_sync => "SET foreign_key_checks = 1"
...   
</code>

h2. Ruby code as sync hook

For more freedom, ruby code can be executed during the hook.
Example:

<code class="brush: ruby; gutter: false">
...  
config.include_tables 'emp',
  :before_table_sync => lambda {|helper| 
    $stderr.puts "Hook called for #{helper.left_table}."
  } 
...   
</code>
